  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Homebrewing is the process of brewing your own beer for personal consumption. Be it because you want to save money, have a specific preference, or want to experiment and have fun!

    Most homebrewers make about 5 gallons worth of beer, but the majority of recipes can be easily scaled for quantities ranging from 1-5+ gallons, the limit being primarily your equipment.

    Extract-Only: Brewing with malt extracts, which are like thick syrups. You can also find hops extracts, though many extract-only brewers tend to prefer hops pellets. Many starter kits are extract-only.

    Partial Mash: Brewing with some extract, some grain. This gives you a bit more control over the malt components of the brew, is more involved, but still accessible to new brewers.

    All Grain: This style of brewing uses no extracts, just grain, and requires a different equipment setup compared to extract-only and partial mash. This is more difficult, but highly customizeable.
